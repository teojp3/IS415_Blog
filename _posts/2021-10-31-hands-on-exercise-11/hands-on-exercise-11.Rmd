# Introduction

Through this exercise, we hope to gain hands-on experience on how to model geographical accessibility using R's geospatial analysis packages.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this hands-on exercise, we will be able to:

- import GIS polygon data into R and save them as simple feature data frame by using appropriate functions of sf package of R;
- import aspatial data into R and save them as simple feature data frame by using appropriate functions of sf package of R;
- utilise computer accessibility measure by using Hansen's potential model and Spatial Accessibility Measure (SAM); and
- visualise the accessibility measures by using tmap and ggplot2 packages.

## Data used

Four data sets will be used, namely:

- `MP14_SUBZONE_NO_SEA_PL`: URA Master Plan 2014 subzone boundary GIS data, from data.gov.sg.
- `hexagons`: A 250m radius hexagons GIS data.  This data set was created by using *st_make_grid()* of **sf** package.  It is in ESRI shapefile format.
- `ELDERCARE`: GIS data showing location of eldercare services, which is downloaded from data.gov.sg. For the purpose of this hands-on exercise, data in ESRI shapefile format will be used.
- `OD_Matrix`: A distance matrix in csv format, with six fields. The respective fields are:

  + `origin_id`: the unique id values of the origin (i.e. `fid` of hexagon data set.),
  + `destination_id`: the unique id values of the destination (i.e. `fid` of `ELDERCARE` data set.),
  + `entry_cost`: the perpendicular distance between the origins and the nearest road),
  + `network_cost`: the actual network distance from the origin and destination, 
  + `exit_cost`: the perpendicular distance between the destination and the nearest road), and
  + `total_cost`: the summation of `entry_cost`, `network_cost` and `exit_cost`.

All the values of the cost related fields are in **metres**.

# Getting Started

## Install and launch R packages

Before we get started, it is important for us to install the necessary R packages and launch them into RStudio environment.

The R packages used for this exercise are:

- Spatial data handling
    - sf
- Modelling geographical accessibility
    - spatialAcc
- Attribute data handling
    - tidyverse, especially readr and dplyr 
- thematic mapping
    - tmap
- Staistical graphic
    - ggplot2
- Statistical analysis
    - ggstatsplot

The code chunk below installs and launches these R packages into RStudio environment.

```{r}
packages = c('tmap', 'SpatialAcc',
             'sf', 'ggstatsplot', 'reshape2',
             'tidyverse')

for(p in packages){
  if(!require(p, character.only = T)){
    install.packages(p)
  }
  library(p, character.only = T)
}
```
**Fun fact:** By installing only the **tidyverse** package, it gives us access to other R packages. Essentially, we won't have to install readr, dplyr and ggplots packages separately. 

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(devtools)
install_version("Rmpfr", repos = "http://cran.us.r-project.org")
```
As we face errors installing **Rmpfr** package using the previous code chunk, the above code chunk will download the package from CRAN repository.

we will then launch the library using the following code chunk.

```{r}
library(Rmpfr)
```

#  Geospatial Data Wrangling  

## Importing geospatial data

Three geospatial data will be imported from the *data/geospatial* sub-folder.  They are **MP14_SUBZONE_NO_SEA_PL, hexagons and ELDERCARE**.

The code chunk below is used to import these three data shapefiles, by using *st_read()* of **sf** packages.

```{r}
mpsz <- st_read(dsn = "data/geospatial", layer = "MP14_SUBZONE_NO_SEA_PL")
hexagons <- st_read(dsn = "data/geospatial", layer = "hexagons") 
eldercare <- st_read(dsn = "data/geospatial", layer = "ELDERCARE") 
```

The report above shows that the R object used to contain the imported MP14_SUBZONE_WEB_PL shapefile is called *mpsz* and it is a simple feature object.  The geometry type is *multipolygon*.  

It is also important to note that *mpsz* simple feature object does not contain EPSG information, so we have to update the CRS later on.

## Updating CRS information

The code chunk below updates the newly imported *mpsz* with the correct ESPG code (i.e. 3414)

```{r}
mpsz <- st_transform(mpsz, 3414)
eldercare <- st_transform(eldercare, 3414)
hexagons <- st_transform(hexagons, 3414)
```

After transforming the projection metadata, we will verify the projection of the newly transformed *mpsz_svy21* by using *st_crs()* of sf package.

```{r}
st_crs(mpsz)
```

Notice that the EPSG: is indicated as *3414* now.

## Cleaning and updating attribute fields of the geospatial data

There are many redundant fields in the data tables of both `eldercare` and `hexagons`.  The code chunks below will be used to exclude those redundant fields. At the same time, a new field called `demand` and a new field called `capacity` will be added into the data table of `hexagons` and `eldercare` sf data frame respectively.  Both fields are derived using *mutate()* of **dplyr** package.  

```{r}
eldercare <- eldercare %>%
  select(fid, ADDRESSPOS) %>%
  mutate(capacity = 100)
```

```{r}
hexagons <- hexagons %>%
  select(fid) %>%
  mutate(demand = 100)
```

Notice that for the purpose of this hands-on exercise, a constant value of 100 is used.  

In practice, actual demand of the hexagon and capacity of the eldercare centre should be used.

# Aspatial Data Wrangling

## Importing Distance Matrix

The code chunk below uses *read_cvs()* of **readr** package to import `OD_Matrix.csv` into RStudio.  The imported object is a tibble data frame called `ODMatrix`.

```{r message=FALSE}
ODMatrix <- read_csv("data/aspatial/OD_Matrix.csv", skip = 0)
```

## Tidying distance matrix

The code chunk below uses *spread()* of **tidyr** package is used to transform the O-D matrix from a thin format into a fat format. 

```{r}
distmat <- ODMatrix %>%
  select(origin_id, destination_id, total_cost) %>%
  spread(destination_id, total_cost)%>%
  select(c(-c('origin_id')))
```

Note: Since tidyr version 1.0 a new function called  *pivot_wider()* is introduced.  So the best practice is to use *pivot_wider()* instead of *spread()*.

Therefore the most updated code chunk should be as such, but we will use *spread()* for this exercise.

```{r eval=FALSE}
distmat <- ODMatrix %>%
  select(origin_id, destination_id, total_cost) %>%
  pivot_wider(destination_id, total_cost) %>%
  select(c(-c('origin_id')))
```

Currently, the distance is measured in metre because the SVY21 projected coordinate system is used.  The code chunk below will be used to convert the unit of measurement from metre to kilometre.

```{r}
distmat_km<-as.matrix(distmat/1000)
```

# Modelling and Visualising Accessibility using Hansen Method

## Computing Hansenâ€™s accessibility

Now, we are ready to compute Hansen's accessibility by using *ac()* of **SpatialAcc** package.  

The code chunk below calculates Hansen's accessibility using *ac()* of **SpatialAcc** and *data.frame()* is used to save the output in a data frame called `acc_Handsen`.

```{r}
acc_Hansen <- data.frame(ac(hexcen$demand,
                            eldercare$capacity,
                            distmat_km, 
                            d0 = 50,
                            power = 2, 
                            family = "Hansen"))
```

The default field name is very messy, we will rename it to `accHansen` by using the code chunk below.

```{r}
colnames(acc_Hansen) <- "accHansen"
```

Next, we will convert the data table into tibble format by using the code chunk below.

```{r}
acc_Hansen <- tbl_df(acc_Hansen)
```

Lastly, *bind_cols()* of dplyr will be used to join the acc_Hansen tibble data frame with the hexagons simple feature data frame.  The output is called `hexagon_Hansen`. 

```{r}
hexagon_Hansen <- bind_cols(hexagons, acc_Hansen)
```

The steps above can be also alternatively be performed by using a single code chunk as shown below.

```{r eval=FALSE}
acc_Hansen <- data.frame(ac(hexagons$demand,
                            eldercare$capacity,
                            distmat_km, 
                            d0 = 50,
                            power = 2, 
                            family = "Hansen"))

colnames(acc_Hansen) <- "accHansen"
acc_Hansen <- tbl_df(acc_Hansen)
hexagon_Hansen <- bind_cols(hexagons, acc_Hansen)
```

## Visualising Hansen's accessibility 

### Extracting map extent

Firstly, we will extract the extent of `hexagons` simple feature data frame by using *st_bbox()* of **sf** package.

```{r}
mapex <- st_bbox(hexagons) #view extent
```

The code chunk below uses a collection of mapping functions of tmap package to create a high cartographic quality accessibility to eldercare centres in Singapore.

```{r fig.width=12, fig.height=8}
tmap_mode("plot")
tm_shape(hexagon_Hansen,
         bbox = mapex) + 
  tm_fill(col = "accHansen",
          n = 10,
          style = "quantile",
          border.col = "black",
          border.lwd = 1) +
tm_shape(eldercare) +
  tm_symbols(size = 0.1) +
  tm_layout(main.title = "Accessibility to eldercare: Hansen method",
            main.title.position = "center",
            main.title.size = 2,
            legend.outside = FALSE,
            legend.height = 0.45, 
            legend.width = 3.0,
            legend.format = list(digits = 6),
            legend.position = c("right", "top"),
            frame = TRUE) +
  tm_compass(type="8star", size = 2) +
  tm_scale_bar(width = 0.15) +
  tm_grid(lwd = 0.1, alpha = 0.5)
```

## Statistical graphic visualisation

In this section, we are going to compare the distribution of Hansen's accessibility values by the respective regions referenced from URA Planning Region.

Firstly, we need to add the planning region field into *hexagon_Hansen* simple feature data frame by using the code chunk below.

```{r}
hexagon_Hansen <- st_join(hexagon_Hansen, mpsz, 
                          join = st_intersects)
```

Next, *ggplot()* will be used to plot the distribution by using boxplot graphical method.

```{r}
ggplot(data=hexagon_Hansen, 
       aes(y = log(accHansen), 
           x= REGION_N)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  geom_point(stat="summary", 
             fun.y="mean", 
             colour ="red", 
             size=2)
```
# Modelling and Visualising Accessibility using KD2SFCA Method

## Computing KD2SFCA's accessibility

In this section, we will repeat most of the steps learned in previous sections to perform the analysis.  Some of the codes will be combined into one code chunk for higher efficiency.  

The code chunk below calculates Hansen's accessibility using *ac()* of **SpatialAcc** and *data.frame()* is used to save the output in a data frame called `acc_KD2SFCA`.  Notice that `KD2SFCA` is used for family argument.

```{r}
acc_KD2SFCA <- data.frame(ac(hexagons$demand,
                            eldercare$capacity,
                            distmat_km, 
                            d0 = 50,
                            power = 2, 
                            family = "KD2SFCA"))

colnames(acc_KD2SFCA) <- "accKD2SFCA"
acc_KD2SFCA <- tbl_df(acc_KD2SFCA)
hexagon_KD2SFCA <- bind_cols(hexagons, acc_KD2SFCA)
```


## Visualising KD2SFCA's accessibility 

The code chunk below uses a collection of mapping functions from ***tmap** package to create a high cartographic quality accessibility to eldercare centres in Singapore.  Notice that `mapex` is reused for *bbox* argument.

```{r fig.width=12, fig.height=8}
tmap_mode("plot")
tm_shape(hexagon_KD2SFCA,
         bbox = mapex) + 
  tm_fill(col = "accKD2SFCA",
          n = 10,
          style = "quantile",
          border.col = "black",
          border.lwd = 1) +
tm_shape(eldercare) +
  tm_symbols(size = 0.1) +
  tm_layout(main.title = "Accessibility to eldercare: KD2SFCA method",
            main.title.position = "center",
            main.title.size = 2,
            legend.outside = FALSE,
            legend.height = 0.45, 
            legend.width = 3.0,
            legend.format = list(digits = 6),
            legend.position = c("right", "top"),
            frame = TRUE) +
  tm_compass(type="8star", size = 2) +
  tm_scale_bar(width = 0.15) +
  tm_grid(lwd = 0.1, alpha = 0.5)
```

## Statistical graphic visualisation

Now, we are going to compare the distribution of KD2CFA accessibility values by URA Planning Regions.

Firstly, we need to add the planning region field into *hexagon_KD2SFCA* simple feature data frame by using the code chunk below.

```{r}
hexagon_KD2SFCA <- st_join(hexagon_KD2SFCA, mpsz, 
                          join = st_intersects)
```

Next, *ggplot()* will be used to plot the distribution by using boxplot graphical method.    

```{r}
ggplot(data=hexagon_KD2SFCA, 
       aes(y = accKD2SFCA, 
           x= REGION_N)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  geom_point(stat="summary", 
             fun.y="mean", 
             colour ="red", 
             size=2)
```
# Modelling and Visualising Accessibility using Spatial Accessibility Measure (SAM) Method

## Computing SAM accessibility

The code chunk below calculates Hansen's accessibility using *ac()* of **SpatialAcc** and *data.frame()* is used to save the output in a data frame called `acc_SAM`.  Notice that `SAM` is used for family argument.

```{r}
acc_SAM <- data.frame(ac(hexagons$demand,
                         eldercare$capacity,
                         distmat_km, 
                         d0 = 50,
                         power = 2, 
                         family = "SAM"))

colnames(acc_SAM) <- "accSAM"
acc_SAM <- tbl_df(acc_SAM)
hexagon_SAM <- bind_cols(hexagons, acc_SAM)
```

## Visualising SAM's accessibility 

The code chunk below uses a collection of mapping functions of **tmap** package to create a high cartographic quality accessibility to eldercare centres in Singapore.  Notice that `mapex` is reused for *bbox* argument.

```{r fig.width=12, fig.height=8}
tmap_mode("plot")
tm_shape(hexagon_SAM,
         bbox = mapex) + 
  tm_fill(col = "accSAM",
          n = 10,
          style = "quantile",
          border.col = "black",
          border.lwd = 1) +
tm_shape(eldercare) +
  tm_symbols(size = 0.1) +
  tm_layout(main.title = "Accessibility to eldercare: SAM method",
            main.title.position = "center",
            main.title.size = 2,
            legend.outside = FALSE,
            legend.height = 0.45, 
            legend.width = 3.0,
            legend.format = list(digits = 3),
            legend.position = c("right", "top"),
            frame = TRUE) +
  tm_compass(type="8star", size = 2) +
  tm_scale_bar(width = 0.15) +
  tm_grid(lwd = 0.1, alpha = 0.5)
```

## Statistical graphic visualisation

Now, we are going to compare the distribution of SAM accessibility values by URA Planning Regions.

Firstly, we need to add the planning region field into *hexagon_SAM* simple feature data frame by using the code chunk below.

```{r}
hexagon_SAM <- st_join(hexagon_SAM, mpsz, 
                       join = st_intersects)
```

Next, ggplot() will be used to plot the distribution by using boxplot graphical method.    

```{r}
ggplot(data=hexagon_SAM, 
       aes(y = accSAM, 
           x= REGION_N)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  geom_point(stat="summary", 
             fun.y="mean", 
             colour ="red", 
             size=2)
```
